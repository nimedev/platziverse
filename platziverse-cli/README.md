### NOTES
- With the property `bin` in package.json file the script is added to PATH when install de module.

- Write `#!/usr/bin/env node` in the begining of script file to use the script from command line.

- The package `minimist` is a parcer of `process.argv`.

- The package `args` is another module used to parce commands. Check it. Is very util to show helps.
